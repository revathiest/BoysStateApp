## Overview

The Boys State Mobile App is designed to help Boys State and Girls State programs manage and deliver information, schedules, and communications to program participants, staff, and parents.  
This app is **not** specific to any one state or program and is intended to be *configurable and secure* for use by any American Legion-affiliated Boys or Girls State chapter.

- **Multi-program support:** Each program can manage its own branding, users, data, and integrations.
- **Strict data separation:** No overlap or access between programs.
- **Role-based access:** Delegates, counselors, admins/staff, and (optionally) parents.
- **Modern stack:** React Native for mobile, Node.js/Express backend, with future integrations for Google Calendar, Google Docs, Discord, and more.
