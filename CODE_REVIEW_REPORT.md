# Code Review Report

This document summarizes a comparison of repository code against project documentation.

## Disclaimers and Licensing
- Multiple markdown files contain a disclaimer that the project is **not** created, funded, or officially supported by the American Legion. Example from `README.md` lines 3-5.
- `LICENSE.md` states the project is licensed under Apache 2.0.
- The application code does not mention affiliation with the American Legion, so it does not conflict with the disclaimer.

## Documentation vs Repository
- `README.md` Quick Start instructs users to copy `.env.example` to `.env`, but the repository does not include `.env.example`.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` instructs running `npm run lint`, but `package.json` has no `lint` script or lint dependencies.
- README lists feature bullet "Cross-platform (React Native / Flutter / [replace with stack])" with a placeholder, which could be updated.

## Feature Implementation Status
Based on `AGENTS.md` description:
- **Authentication Agent:** Basic login flow exists in `LoginScreen.js` using fetch, but token handling and security aspects are minimal.
- **Schedule Agent:** `ScheduleScreen.js` currently only displays a header; actual schedule data integration is not implemented.
- **Notification Agent:** No push or in-app notification logic is present.
- **Branding/Config Agent:** `branding.js` provides color and asset helpers; dynamic loading from backend is partially implemented in `LoginScreen.js`.
- **API Comm Agent:** Fetch calls are used for login and retrieving branding/program data, but broader API communication and error handling are limited.
- **Future agents** such as elections, progress tracking, and parent delegate linking are not implemented.

## Testing
- Automated tests exist under `__tests__/` and cover core components and utilities. Running `npm test` shows they pass with coverage above the thresholds configured in `jest.config.js`.

## Pending Work & Recommendations
1. Provide a `.env.example` file or update documentation to reflect the correct environment setup procedure.
2. Add a linting setup (e.g., ESLint) or remove the lint instruction from `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
3. Replace the placeholder text in README feature list with the actual stack (React Native).
4. Implement planned agents/features listed in `AGENTS.md`, starting with schedule data integration and notification handling.
5. Ensure any future feature additions include corresponding tests per the development standards in `AGENTS.md`.
