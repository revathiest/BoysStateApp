   * MySQL (for local backend development)
3. **Install dependencies:**

   * For the app: `npm install` (in the `app/` directory)
   * For the backend: `npm install` (in the `backend/` directory)
4. **Set up environment variables:**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in both `app/` and `backend/` and update values as needed.

## Coding Standards

* Use meaningful commit messages.
* Follow the architectural patterns described in [`agents.md`](./agents.md).
* Prefer clarity over clevernessâ€”write code that others can easily read and maintain.
* All new code must be covered by meaningful automated tests (see Testing section).
* Ensure no credentials or sensitive data are committed to the repo.

## Submitting Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2. Make your changes, with clear commits and comments.
3. Run all tests and ensure they pass.
4. Submit a pull request (PR) with a clear description of your changes.
5. Reference any related Issues in your PR.
6. Be ready to answer questions or make changes during the code review process.

---

## Testing

* **Automated tests are required** for all new features, bug fixes, and changes.
* Tests must cover all logic paths, edge cases, and error handling.
* All PRs will be blocked from merging if tests fail.
* Use `npm test` or `yarn test` (in both `app/` and `backend/` as appropriate).
* Security and integration tests are especially important for code handling sensitive information.

---

## Reporting Issues & Feature Requests

* Use GitHub Issues to report bugs or request features.
* Please include as much relevant detail as possible (steps to reproduce, environment, screenshots, etc.).
* Tag issues with appropriate labels (bug, feature, help wanted, etc.).

---

## Code of Conduct

* Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
* No harassment, discrimination, or inappropriate language.
* Collaboration and open communication are encouraged.
